# 🌾 Farm Management System (FMS)

A full-stack web application built to help small-scale farmers digitize and manage their farming operations. The system simplifies record-keeping and farm planning for crops, livestock, and resources while also providing tools like custom reminders, interactive report generation, and chatbot assistance — all in one place.
